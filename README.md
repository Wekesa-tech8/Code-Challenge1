In this first code challenge i have tried to create three programs which can be run or be used in our day to day activities. 
The first program is all about calculating students marks and also finding their grades basing on the markes attained, the function
groups groups certain number of students corresponding to their marks, the program makes work easier for teachers as they will not require
repeting many tasks like listing all students with their marks.
The second program entails calculating of speed in which the driver is moving with and his/her qualification, the program detects the changes
in speed thereby awarding or deducting some points, if points are deducted to a certain level the it prints out the driver's licence is suspended.
This program can be widely be used in different companies in transport sector so that they may be able to monitor their workers and also cage
their qualifications.
The third program shows how to calculate net salary of an employer who is entitled to some deductions such as NHIF, NSSF,Tax etc and also some 
benefits eg house allowance,transport etc. The program if applied to a certain company it will automatically calculate each employer's net salary
thereby saving on time and also space# Code-Challenge1
